Refer React js docs

React Js is front end library 

Why we use ReactJS?


The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. 
It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the 
performance of the app. 

The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. 
We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. 
It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.

We can import module using import function

We can use two package managers npm and npx 

npm installes files permenantly while while npx install for one time only 

We can either use react direct in html and create reactApp



render method of React Dom render html codes .
Like this :

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
const ele = React.createElement('h1','{}',"Jai");
root.render(
  
  
<React.StrictMode>
  { <App />  }
</React.StrictMode>
);





Render html code : 
Create element = 

const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);
