______________________
Multiple Receivers
To send an email to more than one receiver, add them to the "to" property of the mailOptions object, separated by commas:

Example
Send email to more than one address:

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com, myotherfriend@yahoo.com',
  subject: 'Sending Email using Node.js',
  text: 'That was easy!'
}

We need just to change mailOptions

Send email containing HTML:

var mailOptions = {
  from: 'youremail@gmail.com',
  to: 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
