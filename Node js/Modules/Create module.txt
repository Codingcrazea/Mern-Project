Create your own module 
Example
Create a module that returns the current date and time:

exports.myDateTime = function () {
  return Date();
};

Use the exports keyword to make properties and methods available outside the module file.

Save the code above in a file called "myfirstmodule.js"

Include your module

var dt = require('./myfirstmodule');

Notice that we use ./ to locate the module, that means that the 
module is located in the same folder as the Node.js file.
