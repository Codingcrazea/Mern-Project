How do you ensure security in a fullstack application?**
   - Implement HTTPS, use environment variables for sensitive data, validate and sanitize user inputs, use authentication and authorization 
mechanisms (e.g., JWT), and protect against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).

7. **Explain the concept of RESTful APIs.**
   - RESTful APIs adhere to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), which include using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to 
interact with resources, stateless interactions, and structured URLs for resource endpoints.

8. **How do you handle user authentication and authorization in a MERN stack application?**
   - Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or session-based authentication. JWTs are often used to verify user identity and manage sessions. 
Implement middleware in Express.js to check for valid tokens and handle authorization based on user roles or permissions.

9. **What are some common performance optimization techniques for a MERN stack application?**
   - Implement server-side caching, use indexing in MongoDB, optimize React rendering with `React.memo` and `useMemo`, 
enable gzip compression, and use lazy loading for components and routes.
